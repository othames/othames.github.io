                                <h2>June - July 2025</h2>
                                <p> A promotional music video for Jesse Leor’s song, Birds.
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  Birds is a love song focussing on the remembrance of old love and the moments that defined it.
                                  For this reason, I chose to film the footage on a grainy children’s camera which I feel gives
                                  a nostalgic quality that looks a little different every time it is rewatched, similar to
                                  memories.
                                  <br />
                                  <br />
                                  For social media viewing, the video was scaled to 1350 x 1080. This forced me to decide between
                                  cropping my shots or adding a border, however, I decided to alter between the two to emphasize
                                  the chorus. An embellishment was additionally added to soften the contrast between the footage
                                  and the border.
                                </p>
