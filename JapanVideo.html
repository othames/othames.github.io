                            <h1>Analysis of a Japanese Stream</h1>

                             This work is a portrayal of the environment one small stream is able to create: the nature it nurtures, the paths it
                             makes, and the people that surround it. In my piece, I strove to capture this impact through the rushes and lulls of
                             its visual and auditory surroundings, and how it presents differently between these extremes as a means of
                             understanding the life of this waterway. What are the minutiae that only the river sees?

                             Shot on a children's camcorder the gritty and blown-out frames allow the experience to feel personal, striving to
                             stretch as far from the unblemished recordings of high-tech, and as close to a perspective from the eyes of the
                             environment as possible. Through this lens, the viewer takes up the role of a natural observer without presence,
                             experiencing the surroundings unseen.
